# Portforlio
Welcome to my workspace! I'm Kunxiao, an undergrad data science student studying at UCSB:)

This portfolio is mainly used to collect and back up my main work and study documents, including but not limited to learning materials, lab codes, project outcomes, and so on. All files shown here are allowed to download for any proper use. For any file containing group works or collaborations, the display permits are obtained with the clear citation to each contributor. The briefly description of each file will be summarized below for easier access, but the description will not go into details since the main purpose of this page is to record my learning progress for personal use.

### Capstone lab
This file mainly includes most of the lab works for PSTAT197A Capstone Project and it is still be to updated. Each `rmd` file contain the codes I summarise in each week's material. The main topic of each lab work is labeled as the file name. 

Untill now, I have already summarised and uploaded the example codes and material about: 

-   `usage of tensorflow`, `iteration Strategies`, `logistic model and accuracy table`, `NLP`, `neural networks`, `splines regression`, and `curve fitting`. 
The files about time series and spatial prediction will be uploaded in the near future. 

The reason why I uploaded those stuffs is that I think they are very useful learning materials containing lots of good example codes, which I could directly apply in the future.
